1. Never create any test files unless I tell you to; never create any document (.md) files for any individual requirement unless I tell you to.

2. Always keep documentation (README, FUNCTIONAL_GUIDE, PROJECT_STRUCTURE, UI_DESIGN) synchronized with requirement/architectural changes, documenting high-level design and logic over implementation details.

3. After each dev phase, generate (don't commit) a single-line English commit message in Conventional Commits format, focusing on business intent (WHY) rather than implementation details (HOW).

4. Use the maximum amount of ultrathink.
